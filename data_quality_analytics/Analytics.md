# Analytics

As some examples of how the users can interact and validate the current state of the transaction data, I put together two dashboards for the users to open and validate data:

## Redemption Quality Analytics
The first dashboard could be used to see the FIFO application of the redemption amounts.  The users could look at this on a daily basis to ensure that totals are tying out and no applications are left outstanding:

## Sales Analytics
The second dashboard could be an example of the customer statistics and sales amounts. This could be expanded to join with additional data points around ARR and Churn risk:
